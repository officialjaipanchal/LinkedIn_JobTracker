🚀 Job Tracker

Built a full-stack job tracker that fetches job postings from LinkedIn for new opportunities — designed for job seekers who want smart automation and tracking in one place.

🧠 Key Features:

🔍 Automated Job Scraper (LinkedIn via Puppeteer)

📊 Application Tracker (status, notes, reminders)

📝 Resume Parser with skill extraction

📈 Analytics Dashboard (success rate, insights)

💻 Tech Stack:

Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Puppeteer, Nodemailer

Frontend: React + React Admin, Material-UI, Recharts

Other: NLP, PDF parsing, logging (Winston), cron jobs

🌐 Fully responsive UI with real-time job status updates, filters, and statistics.

This project made me appreciate how backend automation and clean frontend design can come together to solve real problems in job hunting. More updates coming soon — AI job matching and multi-board support on the roadmap! 💡
